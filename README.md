# PREDICTION-AND-CONTROL-OF-EMPLOYEE-TURNOVER
Problem Description:
Nowadays, employee work satisfaction is an important aspect which the companies have to consider. We intend to work on a dataset related to the employees of a company which contains attributes like employee satisfaction level, number of projects assigned, average monthly hours, time spent at the company, department, salary level etc. and build a model which would predict which of their employees might leave the company in the near future. We would also predict the major factors leading to their resignations.
Motivations:
At present, “Employee turnover” is an important aspect which many major companies are trying to address. In a company, there would be many employees who would not be satisfied with the work they’re doing and leave the company. The companies are trying to know which of their employees are satisfied with the work environment and which of them would leave the company due to improper work-life balance, dissatisfaction due to the environment etc. This is really important for a company because a lot of their resources are invested in selecting the worthy candidates and if they leave abruptly, it would be a waste of the invested resources and they have to look for an apt replacement. Also, losing valuable and talented employees would have an imperative effect on the company’s performance. Many big companies have already started working on such aspects. This motivated us to work on this problem as it is an aggravating one and not properly addressed.

About the files in the project
The ipynb files are the python files which we used to find if a employee is
working or not working in the company by giving some input training
data.
The Matlab files have the programs which can predict the next employee
who is likely to leave from the company.
